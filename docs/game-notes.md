- Formations

- Spawn at cities and eventually can summon around character

## Units - Enemies

- Spawn at dark shrines/altars
- Enemies amass and attack at night and retreat/despawn during day
- Different types: undead, orcs/goblins, beastmen, etc.
- Purging dark shrines can only happen at night and should be difficult but rewarding

## Units - Groups

Formations include:

- Line: buff defense

- Column: buff speed, debuff defense

## Units - Control
